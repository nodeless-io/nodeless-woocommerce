# Nodeless.io  Plugin for WooCommerce

For a detailed feature overview and description go to the official WordPress plugin page:
https://wordpress.org/plugins/nodelessio-for-woocommerce/

This readme is mostly about plugin development on the main repo on GitHub.

## Considerations

The basic structure is a mix of the plugin generator by WP cli tool (file structure, Grunt build runner, etc.) and Composer based setup with GitHub workflows to deploy the artifact to WordPress SVN. WP does not support composer yet so we need to still do fetch dependencies in the build process and adjust to their SVN based structure for committing the code to their plugin ecosystem. This is all handled by the Github workflow.
